# BET: Binary Expression Tree

This project implements a Binary Expression Tree (BET) in C++, 
which builds a tree from a **postfix expression** and supports conversion to **infix** and **postfix** outputs. 
The tree is constructed recursively using a stack-based method, and includes features like deep copying and expression analysis.

## üß† Educational Objective

Gain experience with binary trees and recursive algorithms.
 Practice building trees from postfix input and converting between postfix and infix notation. 
This assignment meets the ABET assessment requirement for demonstrating programming competence.

## üìÅ Files

- `bet.h`: Header file containing the BET class and internal `BinaryNode` struct
- `bet.cpp`: Implementation of the BET member functions
- `proj3_driver.cpp`: Test driver that builds and prints expression trees
- `Makefile`: Builds the executable `proj3.mine.x`

## üîß How to Build

On a Unix/Linux system:

```bash
make
